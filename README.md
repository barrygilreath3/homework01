# Week 01 Homework - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description
This project is the first week's homework assignment of GT Bootcamp.

In this project, I was assigned to refactor existing code to meet a certain set of standards.  In other words, I was given starter code, which I modified to meet accessbility standards.  Here is the user story and acceptance criteria I was given:

### Provided User Story

```
AS A marketing agency

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Provided Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

After refactoring the code, I was then tasked with creating a new repository on my Github account and pushing the code to my Github repository.

Then, I was tasked with creating a Github page from my repository to go live on the Internet.
